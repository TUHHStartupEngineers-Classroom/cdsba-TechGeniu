# Study of New Admission procedure in hospitals

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Load the data frame

```{r}
library(dplyr)
hospital_data  <- readRDS("../../data/hospdd.rds")
```

```{r}
head(hospital_data)
```

```{r}
summary(hospital_data)
```

-   There are 46 hospitals in total, however only the first 18 seem to be relevant to us. As we want to compute the difference between the treatment and the control group

```{r}
treatment_by_month <- hospital_data %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(treatment_count = sum(procedure))

print(treatment_by_month)
```

-   The exact period when the treatment came into effect is not explicitly shown in the question. To make a better estimate, the data was filtered based on the months to find the sum of the treatment values. So this calculation provides a hint when the new admission procedure was introduced. The treatment came into effect from month 4.

```{r}
treatment_month = 4

mean_control_before <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 0, month == treatment_month - 1, hospital > 18) %>%
  summarize(mean_satisfaction = mean(satis, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

mean_treated_before <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 0, month == treatment_month - 1, hospital <= 18) %>%
  summarize(mean_satisfaction = mean(satis, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)


diff_before_treatment = mean_treated_before - mean_control_before

diff_before_treatment


mean_control_after <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 1, month == treatment_month, hospital > 18) %>%
  summarize(mean_satisfaction = mean(satis, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

mean_treated_after <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(procedure == 1, month == treatment_month, hospital <= 18) %>%
  summarize(mean_satisfaction = mean(satis, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(mean_satisfaction)

diff_after_treatment = mean_treated_after - mean_control_after

diff_after_treatment

```

```{r}
counts_treated_group <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(hospital >= 1, hospital <= 18) %>%
  group_by(hospital, procedure) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

counts_treated_group

counts_control_group <- hospital_data %>%
  filter(hospital >= 1, hospital > 18) %>%
  group_by(hospital, procedure) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

counts_control_group
```

```{r}
did_estimate <- diff_after_treatment - diff_before_treatment

did_estimate
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Linear Regression Model

```{r}
model_numeric <- lm(satis ~ month + hospital, data = hospital_data)

model_numeric
```

```{r}
model <- lm(satis ~ as.factor(month) + as.factor(hospital), data = hospital_data)

model

```

-   R would treat both the month and hospital as numeric variables and assuming a linear relationship. On the other hand, with **as.factor** each unique month and hospital are treated as separate categories, allowing for difference intercept for each one as we see from the result.
